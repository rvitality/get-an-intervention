## Fonts

**Why self-host?**
- Ensures the project works fully offline.
- Avoids external dependencies and potential network delays.
- Provides more control over font performance and availability.


> While we could simplify setup using Google Fonts, I've chosen to stick with local fonts to maintain full offline support and minimize external dependencies for this project.
